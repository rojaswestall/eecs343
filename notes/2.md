  - google xv6 book rev11
  - Section on processes would be good for this project

### Operating System Roles

A **resource manager** that allows multiple programs to share one set of hardware

It allows programs to access the hardware/resources

Every program thinks it has the whole machine, but because of the OS it is actually sharing it



### Operating Systems Run Processes

**Process** is a program that is being executed. Bunch of code, plus the memory that is being manipulated by the code.

The OS will assign he process a **process id**. Even if you run the same code twice, the memory and times will be different and they will be assigned their own ids

Each process has it's own view of the computer so they have their own **CPU register**

- general purpose registers
- stack pointers
- instruction pointer register (basically which line of code it's on)

Virtual memory **address space**. Which is abstracted as one big chunk of memory



### A program's view of the computer

There's **virutal memory** (code and data) and **CPU registers** (for arithmetic and logic)

Programs are compiled to **Machine code** which operates on the assumption that these reources are available. The compiler doesn't know what's going to happen at run time so it assumes it has all the resources avaiable to itself

**Memory** is kinda slow cuz it's big. **Registers** are fast czu they're small and right next to each other. Program doesn't know that CPU caches are there. They are hidden. They operate behind the scenes. 



### Assembly level

In C:

```C
void function1() {
  int A =10;
  A += 66;
}
```

In x86 assembly:

```
function1:
	pushl %ebp #
	movl %esp, %ebp #,
	subl $4, %esp #,
	movl$10, -4(%ebp) #, Aleal-4(%ebp), %eax#, addl$66, (%eax) #, Amovl%ebp, %esppopl%ebpret
```



### Limited Direct Execution

Basically this is how the OS supports multi-tasking (concurrent execution)

At any point in time only one process is running and it has exclusive use of the CPU

- It can use all CPU registers

Eventually the OS pauses so another process can run and it will have exclusive use of the CPU

When the OS switches between two process, it's called a **context switch**

### Processes don't run all the time

OS **schedules** processes. A **blocked** process is not ready to run.

I/O means input/output -anything other than computing

- Example: reading/writing disk, sending network packet, waiting for keystroke, updating display
- Whiel waitinf for results, the process often cannot do anything so it **blocks**, telling the OS to let somthing else run.

Three basic process states:

- running
- blocked
- ready to run

Scheduling, through contexts switches, is the way that the OS shares the CPU (a shared resource)

### Process Execution is limited

**User processes** execute with CPU in "**User** mode".

- can only do basic arithmetic, branching, and memory read/write instructions
- will not execute certain privelaged instructions

**OS kernel** runs with the CPU in "**privelaged**/kernel mode"

- Allows all instructions, including:
  - chaning registers that control which memory is accessible
  - Performing I/O, switching CPU

Some processes are privelaged and some are not.

Early CPUs lacked multiple modes so there was no way to keep a process from doing things they didn't want processes doing because they had everything available to it. These different modes, made these at OSs real OSs.



### Examples of things program cannot do itself

- print "hello world"
  - the display is a shared resource
- Download a web page
  - the network card is a shared resource
- Save/read a file
  - filesystem is a shared resource. Needs to check permissions
- Launch another program
  - process are managed by the OS
- Send data to anotehr program
  - each program runs in isoloation, one at a time



### Interrupts

**Interrupts** are things that interrupt the CPU. When it occurs:

- CPU switches to privelaged mode (kernel activates)
  - any instruction can now be executed
- Execution jumps to a predefined location (kernel code)
  - Kernel code is now run to handle this interrupt
- Used to support asynchronous I/O
  - lets hardware tell teh CPU that some data that needs to be serviced
- Can think of it as the CPU having some electrical pin that is charged whenever something needs it's data handled
- There are also instruction for *software* interrupts

There are many types of interrupts:

![image-20190404130445318](/Users/gabrielrojas-westall/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/image-20190404130445318.png)

When a program segfaults, it crashes. The OS decided that the program should no longer run.



### System Calls (syscalls) #64

When a programmer wants to invoke an interrupt on their own.

syscalls are the way that processes ask the OS to do things for them. They do this through an interrupt (**software interrupt**). This could be printing, writing to/opening a file

The syscall **number** and parameters are loaded into pre-defined registers

Kernal takes over during the interrupt handler routine (basically does the work that was requested by the user)

We create syscalls because we want to do something that we can't do on our own. To open a file for example, we would have to use intrsuctions that we don't have privelages to run, so we ask the OS through a syscall interrupt.

Many processes might be trying to use a shared resource (like the screen/printing/files) so we make sure that processes don't mess with each other or the resource.



### Syscalls in xv6

![image-20190404131419449](/Users/gabrielrojas-westall/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/image-20190404131419449.png)

All of the above require special privelages. None of these functions are implemented directly. They all use a macro



### Implementation of syscall user functions in assembly

![image-20190404131551530](/Users/gabrielrojas-westall/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/image-20190404131551530.png)

When the interrupt is run, the handler will look at the number stored in the register to figure out which function to call from the syscall table



### syscall table is defined in syscall.c

![image-20190404131938935](/Users/gabrielrojas-westall/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/image-20190404131938935.png)

By having this table with numbers that reference the handlers, we can change the handlers in the OS so even if all of their addresses get push a little bit, the numbers will still work to reference them as opposed to referncing their address



### How syscall is handled in xv6

### The `int`(errupt) command switches control to the OS

- The CPU will then switch to privelage mode
- it will get the interrupt handler address  by checking the interrupt vector above
- it will check the $eax register for the suscall number
- It will then call the appropriate sycall handler function
- Kernel function will get any parameters left by the user process onthe stask and handle it
- When the handler is done, it will switch back to user mode and resume execution of the user process (using `iret` instruction)



### Interrupts trigger *context switches*

![image-20190404132910836](/Users/gabrielrojas-westall/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/image-20190404132910836.png)

How does the OS switch from one process to another?



### Inactive Process State

OS has a process list in kernal memory to store the CPU state of process that are not currently running.

Basically has to save the state of the process that was previosuly running before it switches so that when it switches back it can use those values again and resume the process.

Context switches read and write this process state.

In xv6's `proc.h`:

![image-20190404133100490](/Users/gabrielrojas-westall/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/image-20190404133100490.png)

The register values are only valid when the process is not running, otherwise they are in the CPU registers



### CPU's state is switched during context switch

### Programmable *timer interrupt*

What's to prevent a program from hogging the CPU forever? If the program never does any I/O or system calls no interrupts will happen and theoritically the kernel will never run. SO we have the programmable **timer interupt**.

The **timer interrupt** is a hardware feature that prevents programs from running forever. When the kernel switches processes, it resets the timer so that it will generate an interrupt after a certain amount of time (anywhere from 1 to 10 milliseconds).



### Recap

**Process** is a program in execution

**Limited direct execution** is a strategy whereby a process usually operates as if it has full use of the CPU and memory

CPUs have user and kernel **modes** to prevent user processes from running privelaged instructions, *limiting* execution.

**Interrupts** are events that cause the kernel to run

**System calls** (or traps) are software interrupts called by a user program to ask the OS to do something on its behalf

**Timer Interrupt** ensures that the kernel eventually runs
