**Lecture 4 - Scheduling**



# Scheduling

**mechanisms** for sharing CPU:

- Limited Direct Execution
- User/Kernel Mode
- Timer Interrupts
- System Calls



**Policy** - decided who gets the CPU and when

- When are running processes interrupted?



### Example

Optimal scheduling of jobs to machines with assumptions:

- jobs of same length
- no new jobs added
- jobs can not be *prempted* (interrupted)
- No I/O is done
- job length is known



# Metrics for scheduling

basically standards for measurements.

Need to choose *metric* ahead of time to figure how something is going to be successful

There are lots of *tradeoffs* 



## Turnaround Time Scheduling Metric

Amount of time waited to finish the job
$$
T_{turnaround} = T_{completion} - T_{arrival}
$$
*Average* turnaround time is computed across all processes

### FIFO (First in First Out)

The first job to come in is run first. Let a job run until it is done, then schedule the next job

##### FIFO shortcomings:

- One big job can cause lots of other jobs behind it to wait
- **Convoy effect** - lots of small jobs getting stuck behind a big one



### Shortest Job First (SJF)

Would have much better turnaround time to minimize the number of *waiting* jobs,

##### SJF Shortcomings:

BUT, jobs could be added after the start of a very long process. This would also give us a really bad turn around time



### Shortest Time-to-Completion First (STCF)

Schedule can **preempt** jobs, basically pausing one to run another one

Evaluates all processes and switches to the one with the least amount of time remaining when a new job arrives

This is the optimal average turnaround time



## Repsonse Time Scheduling Metric

Long jobs may wait a really long time because they have to run last which means they might never run
$$
T_{response} = T_{start} - T_{arrival}
$$
But with response time, we do **not** care how long it takes to *finish* a job

This is basically average start time

This is good fro interactive processes (GUI) which most quickly show that they are reacting to user inputs, but can service requests slowly

We need goo repsonse time and turnaround time (basically start and finish the quickest)



### Round Robin Optimizes Response Time

(RR) scheduling runs a job for a small *time slice*, then schedules the next job



## Different Policies Favor Different Metrics

small time slices can give quick resoponse time, but can cause lots of context switches



#### Context Switching Overhead

It involves switching a few registers, but there is a large cost in "warming" the CPU *caches*.
