## Why study OS

- may need to modify an OS or write device drivers for new hardware
- understand *application* software **performance**
- practice with C, Linux, and tools like git, gcc, gdb, make, etc.

##### Security

- How apps are isolated from each other when running
- *spectre* and *meltdown* attacks

##### Performance

- how virtual memory and paging affects read/write latency
- why programs might be slow or fast based on how they interact with the OS
- how process compete for shared resources

##### Concurrency

- Synchronization (how applications running can coordinate with each other and *not* be isolated, using locks, semaphores. Parralel algorithms that don't deadlock...)
- Non-determinism (how *race conditions* can lead to weird bugs. Basically things happening at the same time)



## Why C is a Good Language for OS

- Interact with hardware directly
  - can include assembly code
    - interrupts, CPU registers, changing CPU modes
  - Direct access to memory to create interrupt tables, etc. (to handle i/o)
    - C pointer is a number specifying a location in memory
- Compiles directly to machine code
  - no translators and libraries
  - bahvior is predictable (no weird garabge collection)
  - inspect machine code to tweak performance
- Very effecient



## Why it's shit

- no standard dynamic collections (lists, dictionaries) ðŸ˜¥
- must manage memory yourself (malloc/free) ðŸ˜’
- cannot easily write generic code ðŸ˜¥
  - strongly typed and no inheritance
- cannot catch/throw exepctions 
  - must check function return status explicitly
- Function params often contain return values
  - have to pass pointer to pre-allocated buffer as a param, and choose buffer size
- No good, free IDE. You will use something like emacs, vim, or edit + make + gdb

## Operating Systems

Operating systems improved as they were able to handle computing more and more things at one time

Using **xv6** because most OSs today are built on it, having a lot of the same features

- Unix version 6
- missing a lot of features that we have today
- about 80,000 lines of code (about 15,000,000 for Linux)
- runs of emulated machine (Qemu)
- lacks drivers for most real hardware accessories/peripherals (can't use netowrk cards, most storage devices, graphics)



## Roles of an OS

##### User Interface

Allows humans to runs the programs. Show files and stuff like finder.

##### Resource Manager!!!

Allowing multiple programs to share one set of hardware

##### Programming Interface

(API) for programs to access the hardware and other services. Call libraries to draw things on screen, detect current location, turn off device, etc.



#### Before Operating Systems

- users could only run one program at a time. Had to insert the program disk before booting the machine
- The program had to control the hardware directly
- program would only be compatible with one set of hardware



OS sits between hardware and applications:

## Parts of the OS

Pretty much have kernel and *not* kernel. In this class we'll really mostly be talking about the Kernel

#### Kernel

the only code without security restrictions

- process scheduling (who uses CPU)
- memory allocation/give different parts of memory to different programs (who uses RAM)
- Accesses hardware devices
  - outputs graphics
  - Reads/writes to network
  - Read/write to disks
  - handles boot-up and power-down

In academic world, OS means the kernel

#### OS Distribution

Other useful things

- GUI/Window manager
- Command Line/Shell
- Software package manager
  - App store, yum, brew, apt
- Common software libraries
- useful apps
  - text editor, compilers, web browser, web server and other ish



OSs first existed on mainframes, but as small devices became powerful, we now see them on things like apple watches!
