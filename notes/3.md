**Lecture 3 - Chapter 5**



### Last Lecture

**Process** is a program in execution

**Limited Direct Execution** is a strategy so a process operates as if it has full access to CPU and memory

CPUs have users and kernel **modes** to prevent processes from running privileged instructions, *limiting* execution

**Interrupts** are events that cause the kernel to run (exception in CPU or something)

**System Calls** are interrupts so programs can access machine resources

**TImer interrupt** periodaclly occurs to make sure the kernel is run at some point

### "Hello World" with syscalls (in Linux)

```C
int main() {
  write(1, "Hello, world\n", 13);
  exit(0);
}
```

`printf` is a libc function so we don't use it.

libc's implementation of `printf` uses `write`, which is a syscall

**Mechanisms** are the way we do something

- Interrupt handling
- Context switching
- memory management

Different on different machines



**Policies** 

- scheduling
- memory management

Can be the same



### Process Creation

Combination of `fork` and `exec`

`fork()` creats an exact duplicate of the current process, except

- has new proces id
- return code of `fork()` command is different

`exec()` overwrites the code of the current process with that in a file. Turns something into an exectuable file



### Nondeterminism

The new (child) process continues where the parent left off.

- it does not start from the beginning of `main()`

`fork()` returns:

- 0 to the child process
- the child pid to the parent

The two processes share the same `stdin`, `stdout`, and `stderr`

```C
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  printf("hello world (pid:%d)\n", (int) getpid());
  int rc = fork();
  if (rc < 0) { // fork failed; exit
    fprintf(stderr, "fork failed\n");
    exit(1);
  } else if (rc ==0) { // child (new process)
    printf("hello, I am child (pid:%d)\n", (int) getpid());
  } else { // parent goes down this path
    printf("hello, I am parent of %d (pid:%d)\n",
          rc, (int) getpid());
  }
  return 0;
}

// POSSIBLE OUTPUT:
// hello world (pid:29146)
// hello, I am parent of 29147 (pid:29146)
// hello, I am child (pid:29147)

// POSSIBLE OUTPUT:
// hello world (pid:29146)
// hello, I am child (pid:29147)
// hello, I am parent of 29147 (pid:29146)

```

At the end of the fork syscall, the OS has two runnable processes

It is not possible to predict whether the OS will schedule the parent of child process to run next

- This depends on runtime situation and hidden kernel implementation

Therefore, the programs output is **nondeterministic** or **indeterminate**

**Race condition:**

- Two or more things are happening at one time
- not clear which will finish first
- output will be different depending on which finishes first

In the `fork()` example, the two competing tasks were:

- Parent process waiting to run and pring
- child process waiting to run and print

**Heisenbug** - a bug that disappears when testing (in these cases it might be due to timing)



```C
int main() {
  //open a file
  int fd = open(filename, O_RDWR);
  if (fd == -1) { /* Handle error */ }
  
  char c;
  pid_t pid = fork();
  if (pid == -1) { /* Handle error */ }
  // child
  if (pid == 0) {
    read(fd, &c, 1);
    printf("child:%c\n", c);
  }
  // parent
  else {
    read(fd, &c, 1);
    printf("parent:%c\n", c);
    do_some_work();
    //close the file
    close(fd);
  }
  return 0;
}
```



Would be an error because the parent might run first and close the file that the child will try to read from a closed file.

Although, this error would very unlikely occur because the parent has to do some work, so there's likely going to be some context switch that allows the child to read before the parent gets to closing the file.

This is a **race condition** between the child's and parent's `close`



### CPU Exceptions are a type of Interrupt

- often caused by arithmetic erros (divide by 0), memory violations (like referencing an address that doesn't exist or dereference a null pointer)
- when **user** code causes an exception
  - kernel interrupt handler rund, will kill the user process
- When the kernel causes the exception, it can't really kill itself so
  - interrupt handler will run
  - Windows: blue screen of death
  - Linux: "kernel panic"
  - Commonly seen by kernel developers
  - This is different than the machine freezing because the kernel knows there is a problem it just doesn't know how to react



### Starting a Process

Copy machine code and initial data into memory

- basically copy the executable code into memory

Set instruction pointer register to address of code start

- (jump to code start)

The code will then use the registers and memory as necesary to perform it's work



#### Stack

- Execution stack, machine stack, call stack, control stack

This just makes it easy for the assembly programmer/compiler

- allows programs to call subroutines and manage local variables with just a few instructions

Stack pointer (`%esp`) is used & automatically adjusted by:

- Push, pop
- Call, ret

The stack simplifies machine code generation for C-style functions

Current function's local variables are on top of the stack

To return:

- restore caller's stack frame by restoring `%esp`, `%ebp`
- Places function's return value in `%eax`

#### Heap

**Heap** is where C's `malloc` function dynamically allocates memory

CPU has no notion of a heap region

Stack and heap grow toward each other, eating free space

Both stack and heap just grow as the grow, you don't allocate memory at the beginning. Maximum stack size does not have to be predetermined, but it does have a maximum size it can grow to

Kernel and I/O reserved spaces causes program to crash if programs try to write to them.



### Context Switch to change process

**Context switches** swap out all process states. The registers are small and fast so they can quickly be saved and restored

Memory is big so it would be slow to copy all the memory to disk

Instead, it puts it in the dynamically coded shared library.
